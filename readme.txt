Extra credit work

For the extra credit, I created a discounts page, about page and product details page for all the product types.

While I only used HTML/CSS for the actual assignment, in the about page I used a single line of in-line javascript to navigate back from the about page to the previous page since that is cleaner than making 6 different about page copies for each other page. I hope that is not a problem.
